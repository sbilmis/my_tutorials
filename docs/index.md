# 👋 Welcome to My Digital Notebook

Hi! This is a personal collection of tutorials, notes, and workflows that I use in my day-to-day work as a **System Administrator** and **Researcher**.

I created this site primarily to document technical solutions so I don't have to "re-learn" them six months later. If you find them useful for your own research or projects, that's great too!
