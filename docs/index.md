# 👋 Welcome to My Digital Notebook

This site is a small personal notebook where I write down
technical notes and short tutorials that I use in my own work.

The main purpose is simple:
to avoid re-learning the same things again months later.

Some of these notes may also be useful to others working with
Linux systems, data handling, or research workflows.

> This notebook grows slowly and irregularly, depending on real needs.
